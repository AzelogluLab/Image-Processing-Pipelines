mainScript_v2, July 28, 2022
- micronsPerPixel was previously a single value, assuming that all image sets had the same spatial resolution. This was upgraded so that it can now be a vector of values, 
allowing images of differing resolution to be analyzed in one script.
- Additionally, the filter for removing segmented objects smaller than the the size in pixels^2 specified by minAreaPixels is now replaced with minAreaMicrons which removes
objects smaller than this specified size in microns^2.
- Added solidity, aspect ratio, as a measurement.
